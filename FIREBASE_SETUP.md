# Firebase Setup Guide for Coder Cashflow

This guide will help you configure Firebase to enable CSV uploads and data persistence.

## Issue Summary

The CSV upload functionality was not working because Firebase environment variables were not configured. This prevents the application from connecting to Firestore database where transaction data is stored.

## Quick Fix

### Step 1: Create Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "Add project" or select an existing project
3. Follow the setup wizard

### Step 2: Get Firebase Configuration

1. In your Firebase project, click the gear icon → "Project settings"
2. Scroll down to "Your apps" section
3. Click "Add app" → "Web" (if no web app exists)
4. Register your app with a nickname (e.g., "Coder Cashflow")
5. Copy the configuration object that looks like:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key-here",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

#### For Local Development:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```bash
# Firebase Configuration
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-your-measurement-id
```

2. Replace all `your-*` values with your actual Firebase configuration
3. Restart your development server (`npm start`)

#### For Production (Vercel/Netlify):

1. Go to your deployment platform dashboard
2. Navigate to Environment Variables section
3. Add each `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_*` variable with its value
4. Redeploy your application

### Step 4: Configure Firestore Security Rules

1. In Firebase Console, go to "Firestore Database"
2. Click "Rules" tab
3. Replace the rules with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId}/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // For development - allow all (remove in production)
    // match /{document=**} {
    //   allow read, write: if true;
    // }
  }
}
```

4. Click "Publish"

### Step 5: Enable Authentication

1. In Firebase Console, go to "Authentication"
2. Click "Get started" if not already set up
3. Go to "Sign-in method" tab
4. Enable your preferred sign-in methods (Email/Password, Google, etc.)

## Verification

1. Start your application
2. You should see a green "Firebase Connected" status in the upload section
3. Try uploading a CSV file
4. Check the browser console for detailed logs

## Troubleshooting

### Firebase Status Shows "Disconnected"

- **Missing Variables**: Check that all `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_*` environment variables are set
- **Placeholder Values**: Make sure you replaced placeholder values with actual Firebase config
- **Case Sensitivity**: Environment variable names are case-sensitive
- **Restart Required**: Restart your development server after adding environment variables

### CSV Upload Fails

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for detailed error messages
2. **Authentication**: Make sure you're logged in
3. **Firestore Rules**: Verify security rules allow writes for authenticated users
4. **Network Issues**: Check your internet connection
5. **Firebase Project**: Ensure the project exists and Firestore is enabled

### Common Errors and Solutions

| Error Message | Solution |
|---------------|----------|
| "Firebase not initialized" | Set environment variables and restart server |
| "Permission denied" | Check Firestore security rules |
| "User not authenticated" | Log out and log back in |
| "Batch commit failed" | Check Firebase project quotas and billing |

## Testing Your Setup

1. **Environment Check**: The app now shows Firebase connection status
2. **Upload Test**: Try uploading the sample CSV file included in the project
3. **Console Logs**: Check browser console for detailed operation logs
4. **Error Display**: Any errors now show detailed troubleshooting information

## Enhanced Debugging Features

The fixes include:

- ✅ **Firebase Status Component**: Shows connection status and missing variables
- ✅ **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error messages with solutions
- ✅ **Detailed Logging**: Console logs show every step of the upload process
- ✅ **Validation**: Checks for placeholder values in environment variables
- ✅ **Error Analysis**: Upload results show specific troubleshooting tips

## Support

If you're still having issues:

1. Check the browser console for detailed error logs
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Make sure your Firebase project has Firestore enabled
4. Ensure your Firebase billing account is active (if required)

The application now provides much better debugging information to help identify and resolve issues quickly.
